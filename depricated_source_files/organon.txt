PREFACE 


Witu an eye to the English reader, who knows, 
perhaps, little of logic and less in that case of 
Auistotle’s, I have tried in translating these texts 
to bring out the pmlosopher’s meaning as clearly as 
was in my power How far I have succeeded in 
doing so, provided I interpret 1t rightly, the reader 
alone can determine I cannot, in consequence, 
pretend that I hterally translate the Gieeh, where 
it seemed that a literal translation would fail to 
achieve this main purpose Some scholars ma 
possibly object that at times I paraphrase Aristotle 
I can in that case only plead that a more οἱ less 
intelligible paraphrase does convey something to the 
reader, unlike stiict adherence to the letter More- 
over, a literal translation might often repel English 
readeis and read hke some alien jargon, as well as 
in all piobability demanding rathei copious notes, 
which are foreign from the scope of this series 

The Greek text here printed is Bekker’s, except 
fo. some shght deviations that are noted at the foot 
of the page 

The short introduction that follows was submitted 
to the Piovost of Oriel I have to thank my friend 
and former tutor, Lt -Col A S L Farquharson, for 
help and advice on certain points in regaid to the 
meaning of the texts

THE CATEGORIES 


VOL I A? 


INTRODUCTION 


Wuat is the subject of the Categories? In ordinary 
usage aatyyopia, rendered in English as ‘ category,’ 
meant nothing more than ἡ ἃ predicate ’ This mean- 
ing it seems highly probable that 1t retains in this 
text The ten categories, then, are ten predicates 
What sort of predicates, however, and predicates also 
of what? Let us first raise another point here If 
we ask how Aristotle came by them, the critics 
are not mm agreement The following seems, on 
the whole, the most plausible view of the matter 
‘ Aristotle,’ says Theodor Gomperz, ‘ :magines a man 
standing before him, say in the Lyceum, and passes 
in successive review the questions which may be put 
and answered about him All the predicates which 
can be attached to that subject fall under one or 
other of the ten heads, from the supreme question 

What 1s the object here perceived ἢ down to such a 
subordinate question, dealing with mere externalities, 
as What has he on’ What equipment or accoutie- 
ments, eg shoes or weapons’ Other questions are 
concerned with his qualities and his size (white, 
instructed in grammar, so many feet tall), under 
the head of relation (Related to what) come answers 
mn which a term such as Greater or Less, Handsomer 
or Ugher, implies a reference to an object or objects 
of comparison The “When” is explained by a

INTRODUCTION 


Yesterday or To-morrow, the Doing and Suffering 
by the sentences ‘‘ He is cutting or burning,” 
‘““He is bemg cut or burnt’ The enumeration is 
intended to comprise the maximum of predicates 
which can be assigned to any thing or being A 
maximum, be 1t observed, for it can hardly be by 
chance that the full number is found in only two 
passages of the worh, while the two which are at 
once the most special and the least important, those 
relating to Having, or possession, and to Lying, or 
attitude, are in every other case passed over without 
mention And indeed, what sense could there be 
in speaking of the possessions of a stone or a piece of 
iron, or of the attitude of a sphere or a cube * We 
further observe that several others of the categories 
are often lumped together under the one name of 
“ Affections, while others are collectively designated 
“ Motions ”’’* Grote took a similar view ‘ Now 
what 1s remarkable,’ he wrote, ‘ about the ninth and 
tenth Categories 1s, that individual persons or animals 
are the only Subjects respecting whom they are ever 
predicated, and are at the same time Subjects 
respecting whom they are constantly (or at least 
frequently) predicated An individual person 15 
habitually clothed in some particular way im all or 
part of his body, he (and perhaps his horse also) 
are the only Subjects that are ever so clothed More- 
over animals are the only Subjects, and among them 
man 18 the principal Subject, whose changes of posture 
are frequent, various, determined by internal 1m- 
pulses, and at the same time interesting to others to 
know Hence we may infer that when Aristotle 


5 Greek Thinkers (Eng tr), vol w Ὁ 39 ‘A maximum,’ 
too, for a man, for a man might have no clothing on! 


3 


ARISTOTLE 


lays down the Ten Categories, as Summa Genera for 
all predications which can be made about any given 
Subject, the Subject which he has wholly, or at least 
principally, τῷ his mind is an individual Man We 
understand, then, how 1t 1s that he declares Habere 
and Jacere to be so plain as to need no further 
explanation What is a man’s posture’ What 1s 
his clothing or equipment ἢ are questions understood 
by every one *2 

If the views thus expressed are correct (and they 
seem to admit of no doubt) in regard to the source 
of the doctrine, we can draw, I think, certain con- 
clusions respecting the nature of the categories, as 
they appear in this text, as distinct from other texts 
of Aristotle, and, at least, in their primary significance 
They constitute the most general predicates assign- 
able to one single subject That subject can only 
be either an individual man or an ammal Of any 
other subject whatever not all of them are possible 
predicates They constitute, therefore, ‘a maxi- 
mum, as Theodor Gomperz well puts 1+ To certam 
other namable entities a number may, doubiless, 
belong, and, moreover, on a secondary view, at 
least one may belong to all others We may thus 
describe everything existing as a substance or quan- 
tity or quality or refer it to one of the others 

This latter pomt brings us, I think, to a common 
explanation of the doctrine Dr Ross, for e,ample, 
considers that ἡ the categories are a list of the widest 
predicates which are predicable essentially of the 
various namable entities, 26, which tell us what 
kinds of entity at bottom they are’® IfI understand 


® Aristotle (ed 2, 1880), p 79

INTRODUCTION 


this statement correctly, this means that the ultimate 
answer to the question what 1s red 15 a quality,’ 
the ultimate answer to the question what space 15 
or time 15 ‘a quantity’ On that view each namable 
entity falls under only one category, having one only 
ἔοι predicate And surely one category only can tell 
us what a thing 1s ‘at bottom’ Now, a careful 
mspection of the text shows, I think, that this view 
1s correct Aristotle, m particular, of quantity 
enumerates several examples, such as time, space, 
speech, lines, sohds, numbers And if you were to 
ash what these are, then the ultimate answer to the 
question 1s ‘ quantities discrete or continuous ’ More- 
over, he expressly reminds us that only some things, 
strictly speaking, belong to the category of quantity 
This imphes that all namable things can be classed 
unde: one or another And the fact that he admits 
the possibility of a thing’s falling under two categories 
scarcely affects the main point And this view 18 
consistent with our statement that one of the cate- 
gories, at least, will belong to each namable entity 

These contentions, I think, will hold good Not, 
however, of the classification τῷ its earhest form 
and significance Fo nothing, indeed, in that case 
appears clearer, at least to my mind, than that all of 
the ten were envisaged as the predicates of one sengle 
subject This 1s not to deny that the doctrine has 
additional aspects or meanings and that 1t might 
come to be made to serve purposes other than the 
primal and, possibly, far more mmportant 

So, again, we may properly argue that one subject 
of our text is the meanings of ‘ uncombined,’ “ 1so- 
lated words ’ (or of terms as opposed to propositions) 
and the things signified by those terms Thus the 


5 


ARISTOTLE 


doctrine of the categou1es may serve as ἃ classification 
of such meanings It is only again im regard to 
the primary sense of that doctrine that I do not 
quite follow Dr Ross ‘It would seem,’ so he says 
very briefly, ‘ that in its earliest form the doctrine 
was a classification of the meanings of, ze of the 
things meant by, ‘‘ uncombined words,’ in other 
words an inventory of the main aspects of reality, 
so far at least as language takes account of them ἡ“ 
This seems to me only to be true of the doctrine ‘in 
its earhest form,’ if ‘reality 15 taken as meaning an 
individual man or an animal 

Then the terms of the text make it evident, as 
Gomperz has nghtly observed, that the doctrine 
had a definite bearmg, in the uses to which it was 
put, on the theory and practice of disputation—a 
matter of small interest now Otherwise we should 
not find it dealing with the subject of dialectical 
questions 

That the subject of all the ten categoules 1s an 
mdividual man or an animal may be possibly due in 
some measure not only to actual observation of men 
in the market-place of Athens but also to Aristotle’s 
holding that the real 15 the concrete individual And 
what better instance could he take with a view to 
iullustratmg his lectures than a Plato, a Callas, a 
Socrates, or (being possessed of some humour) some 
member of his logical classes ἢ 

This view presupposes, of course, that the doctrine 
derives from Anstotle Some scholars deny this or 
doubt it, supposing he found it ready-made and took 
it over complete from the Academy  Ceitain pomts 
may lend colour to this theory, among them the fact

INTRODUCTION 


we have noticed, that some of the categories only 
appear to possess real importance or even come m 
for much notice Any positive evidence τῇ its favour 
it is difficult, however, to adduce And the wnitings 
of Plato himself do not seem to lend any support to 1t 4 

One objection to regarding the categories as pre- 
dicates calls for brief notice It is true, the first 
category 1s substance and so-called first substance Ὁ 
individual, and what 15 individual can never be, 
properly speahing, a predicate But, τῇ we ask what 
Plato is, then the answer we shall give in the long 
run as being the broadest about him 15 that he 1s ‘a 
primary substance,’ a concrete and mdividual man 
So in that sense ‘ first substance ’ 1s a predicate 

The text, On Interpretation, does not require much 
comment here It was seemmgly so called since 
language was regarded as interpreting thought If 
we say that the Categories for subject has ‘ isolated,’ 
‘uncombined terms,’ then this text has propositions, 
their theory, analysis and so on for subject and 1s 
specially concerned with developing the possible 
oppositions between them The distinction between 
‘true’ and ‘ false’ also naturally finds a place here 
Propositions are called “ true’ and ‘ false,’ a distinc- 
tion without any meaning as applied to mere ‘ un- 
combined terms’ Aristotle assumes here that truth 
is a kind of correspondence with realty Concepts 
are ‘likenesses’ of things Propositions combine 
or separate them They are true, when the things 
represented are similarly combmed or separated , 
they are false in the contrary cases Apart from 


¢ Failing positive evidence to the contrarv, I take the 
traditional view that the first nine chapters of this text are 
the genuine work of Aristotle 


7 


ARISTOTLE 


what Aristotle says or implies of the concepts them- 
selves, this 1s open to all the objections that are valid 
against Locke and others The reader may com- 
pare this from Locke ‘Truth, then, seems to me, 
m the proper import of the word, to signify nothing 
but the young or separating of Signs, as the Things 
signified by them do agree or desagree one nth another 

The joming or separating of signs here meant, 1s 
what by another name we call propositzon So that 
truth properly belongs only to propositions whereof 
there are two sorts, viz mental and verbal, as 
there are two sorts of signs commonly made use of, 
viz ideas and words ’4

THE CATEGORIES 


SUMMARY OF THE PrincrpaL THEMES 


The meaning of univocal, equivocal and 
deiivative terms 

Expressions are simple Οἱ complex 

Things are (1) asserted of a subject, (2) 
present in a subject, (3) both (1) and (2) or 
(4) neither (1) nor (2) 

Predicates of the predicate are predicable 
also of the subject 

The categories stated in outhne 

Of Substance 

Pimmary and secondary substance defined 
What is not pimmaiy substance is either 
asseited of 01 present in a primary substance 
If puumairy substances did not exist, neither 
would anything else 

Of secondary substances species more tiuly 
substance than genus 

All species, not being genera, are substance 
in the same degiee, so are all primary 
substances 

No secondary substance other than genus 
and species 

Primary substance related to secondary sub- 
stance and all other predicates as secondary 
substance to all othe: predicates

Neither primary nor secondary substances 
present in a subject 

Primary substance individual, secondary sub- 
stance a qualification of the individual 
Substances have no contraries 

Substances never admit of degrees 

The characteristic peculiar to substance 19 
that contrary quahties are predicable of 1t 
Of Quantity 

Quantity discrete or continuous 

The parts of some quantities have relative 
positions, while the parts of others have not 
Quantitative terms may be used of things 
other than quantity 

‘Great,’ ‘small’ and similar terms not 
quantitative but relative 

Quantities never admit of degrees 

The characteristic peculiar to quantity 1s that 
we predicate ‘ equal’ and ‘ unequal οὗ υὖ 
Of Relation 

Preliminary definition 

Some relatives have contraries 

Some relatives admit of degrees 

Every relative has a correlative 

The relative must have its proper name, 
only so 15 the correlative evident Necessity 
in certam cases for coming new names for 
the purpose 

Relatives usually come into being together 
Exceptions in the case of perception and 
knowledge 

Primary substance never relative, neither 
any pait of such substance

Of Quality 

Qualities defined 

Ther kinds (1) habits and dispositions, 
(2) capacities, (3) affective qualities and 
affections, (4) shape, figure and so on 

Most qualities have contraries 

If one of two contraries 1s a quality, so 1s 
the other 

Most qualities admit of degrees 

The characteristic pecuhar to quality is that 
we predicate ‘ke ’and‘ unlike in reference 
to it

ARISTOTLE’S CATEGORIES 


I Things are equivocally? named, when they have 
the name only in common, the definition (or state- 
ment of essence) corresponding with the name being 
different Foi instance, while a man and a portrait 
can properly both be called animals,’ these are 
equivocally named ® Fo. they have the name only 
un common, the definitions (or statements of essence) 
corresponding with the name being different For 
if you are asked to define what the being an animal 
means in the case of the man and the portrait, you 
give in either case a definition appropriate to that 
case alone 

Things are univocally named, when not only they 
bear the same name but the name means the same 
in each case—has the same definition corresponding 
Thus a man and an ox are called anmals’ The 
name 1s the same in both cases , so also the statement 
of essence For if you are asked what 1s meant by 
their both of them being called ‘ ammals,’ you give 
that particular name in both cases the same definition 

Things are ᾿ derivatively ᾿ named that derive their 
own name from some other, that 1s given a new verbal 


creature, and, secondly, a figure or image in painting, em- 
bioidery, sculpture We have no ambiguous noun How- 
ever, we use the word ‘living’ of portraits to mean ‘ true 
to life ’

III A word upon predicates here When you 
predicate this thing or that of another thing as of 
a subject, the predicates then of the predicate will 
also hold good of the subject We predicate ‘man’ 
of a man, so of ‘man’ do we predicate ‘animal ἢ 
Therefore, of this 01 that man we can predicate 
‘ammmal’ too For a man is both ‘animal’ and 
“man 

When genera are co-ordinate and different, differ- 
entiae will differ τῷ kind® Take the genera, animal 
and knowledge ‘ Footed,’ ‘ two-footed,’ ‘ winged,’ 
‘aquatic ᾿ 816 among the differentiae of animal But 
none will be found to distinguish a particular species 
of knowledge No species of knowledge will differ 
fiom another in being ἡ two-footed ’ 

Wheie the genera, however, are subordinate, 
nothing whatever prevents them from having the 
same differentiae For we predicate the higher or 
large: of the smaller or subordinate class The 
differentiae, then, of the predicate will also belong to 
the subject 

IV Each uncombined woid or expression means 
one of the followmg things —what (or Substance), 
how large (that 1s, Quantity), what sort of thing (that 
is, Quality), related to what (or Relation), where (that 
is, Place), when (or Time), in what attitude (Posture, 
Position), how cucumstanced (State or Condition), 
how active, what domg (or Action), how passive, 


‘building’ 1s the genus and ‘used for a dwelling’ the 
difference, we then have the species called ‘ house ’

what suffering (Affection) * Examples, to speak but 
in outhne, of Substance are ‘man’ and ‘a hoise,’ 
of Quantity “two cubits long,’ “three cubits m 
length’ and the hke, of Quality ‘white’ and 
‘grammatical Terms such as ‘half,’ ‘double,’ 
‘greater’ are held to denote a Relation ‘In the 
market-place,’ ‘in the Lyceum ’ and similar phrases 
mean Place, while Time 1s intended by phrases hke 
‘yesterday,’ ‘last year’ and so on ‘Is lying’ or 
‘sitting’ means Posture, ‘1s shod’ or ‘1s armed’ 
means a State ‘Cuts’ or ‘ burns,’ again, indicates 
Action, ‘1s cut’ or ‘1s burnt’ an Affection 

Not one of these terms in itself will involve any 
positive statement Affirmations, as also demals, can 
only arise when such terms are combined or united 
together Each positive or negative statement must 
either be true or be false—that, at least, 1s allowed 
on all hands—but an uncombined wo1d or expression 
(for instance, ‘man, “ white,’ ‘runs’ or ‘ conquers ’) 
ean neither be true nor be false 

V Substance in the truest and strictest, the 
primary sense of that term,1is that which is neither 
asserted of noi can be found im a subject ® We take 
as examples of this a particular man or a horse But 
we do speak of secondary substances—those within 
which, being species, the primary or fust are included, 
and those within which, bemg genera, the species 
themselves are contamed For instance, a particular 
man we include in the species called ‘ man’ and the 
species itself in its turn 1s included in the genus called 
accidental predicates Aristotle undersubstance distinguishes, 
first of all, primary substance, that 1s to say, the individual 
(or this or that man, for example), and, secondly, secondary 


substances, that 1s, the species and genera in which the 
individuals are included

‘anmal’ These, then, are secondary substances, 
that 15 to say, man and animal—othei wise, species and 
genus 

From what we have said it 1s plain that the name 
and definition of the predicates can both be affirmed 
of the subject For mstance, we predicate ‘man’ 
of an individual man as the subject The name of 
the species called ‘man’ 15 asserted of each indi- 
vidual, you predicate “man’ of a man The de- 
fintion or meaning of ‘ man’ will apply to ὦ man, in 
hike manner, for a man is both man and an animal 
The name and definition of the species will thus both 
apply to the subject 

When we come, on the contrary, to things which 
are present οἱ found im a subject, we find that their 
names and definitions we cannot, at least in most 
cases, affirm or predicate of that subject Indeed, 
the definition itself will in no case whatever apply 
But in some cases nothing prevents us from using the 
name of the subject Suppose we take ‘ white’ as an 
unstance Now‘ white is, no doubt, in a body and 
thus 1s affii:med of a body, fo. a body, of course, 1s 
ealled ‘ white’ The definition, however, of ‘ white’ 
—of the colour, that 1s, we call ‘ white ’"—can never 
be predicated of any such body whatever ¢ 

Everything else but first substance 15 either 
affirmed of first substance or present in such as its 
subject This 1s evident from particular imstances 
taken by way of examples We predicate ‘ animal’ 
of ‘man’ So we predicate ‘animal’ also of any 
particular man Were there no mdividuals exist- 
ing of whom it could thus be affirmed, 1t could 


adjective, commonly speaking, but also at times as a noun, 
when 1t means ‘ a white paint’ or ‘ white colour’

not be affirmed of the species Colour, again, is in 
body , so also in this or that body For were there 
no bodies existing wherein it could also exist, τὸ 
could not be in body at all In fine, then, all things 
whatsoever, save what we call pimary substances, 
are predicates of primary substances or present in 
such as their subjects And were there no primary 
substance, nought else could so much as exist 

Of secondary substances species 15 better called 
substance than genus it 1s neare: to primary sub- 
stance, while genus 15 more removed from it Sup- 
pose someone asks you ‘what 1s it ἢ regarding a 
primary substance Your answer is both more 
instiuctive and also more apt to the subject, provided 
you mention its species than 1f you should mention 
rts genus Take this or that man, forexample You 
would give a more instructive account, 1f you stated 
the species or ‘man,’ than you would, if you called 
him ‘an animal’ The former belongs the more to 
him, the latter 1s somewhat too wide Or, again, 
take an individual tree By mentioning the species 
οἱ ‘ tree ’ you will give a more instructive account than 
by giving the genus or ἡ plant ’ 

Moreover, the primary substances most of all merit 
that name, since they undeulie all other things, which 
in tuin will be either their predicates or present in 
such as their subjects But exactly as primary sub- 
stances stand to all else that exists, so also stands 
species to genus Species is related to genus as 
subject is 1elated to predicate We predicate genus 
of species, but never, indeed, can we predicate 
species of genus conversely On this further ground 
we may hold that of secondary substances species 
is more truly substance than genus

If we turn to the specics themselves, none, unless 
itis also a genus, 1s moe of a substance than another 
No apter description is ‘man’ of a conciete or 
individual man than is ‘ hoise of a concrete hoise 
So also of primaiy substances—none 1s more a sub- 
stance than others For this οἱ that man, ἔοι example, 
could not well be more truly substance than, let us 
say, this or that ox 

Apart, then, fiom primary substances, species and 
genus alone of the things that will then remain over 
are rightly called secondary substance, for they of all 
possible predicates alone define primary substance 
kor only by species or genus can this or that man be 
defined in a fit or appropriate way, and we make 
our definition preciser by stating the species or 
‘man ’ than by stating the genus οἱ ‘ animal’ Any- 
thing else we might state, as, for instance, ‘he runs’ 
or ‘1s white,’ would be foreign from the purpose in 
hand So species and genera only are nghtly 
designated as substance, first substances only 
excepted 

“Substance, again, strictly speaking, applies to 
first substances only, because they not only underlie 
but provide all things else with thew subjects 
Exactly as primary substance 15 1elated to all else 
whatever, so also are genus and species, in which is 
meluded that substance, related to all attirbutes not 
included in genus and species Foi these are the 
subjects of such You may call a man ‘ learned mn 
grammar And, therefore, his species and genus, 
that 1s to say, man and animal, you may also call 
‘learned in grammar ’ And this will be soin all cases 

That τὸ never is present in a subject holds good of

substance can neither be present in a subject nor yet 
predicited of one And as for the secondary sub- 
stance, the following points, among otheis, will prove 
it 18 not m a subject We predicate ‘man’ of a 
min, ‘man,’ however, 1s not 2z a subject Tor man- 
hood 15 not zz a man As the species, so also the 
genus For ‘ animal’ 1s also asserted of this or that 
man in particular but cannut be found piesent in 
him Again, we may notice this pout When a 
thmg can be found in a subject, then nothing prevents 
us fiom using its name of the subject in question , 
not so the definition, however And yetofasecondary 
substance both name and definition hold good in the 
case of the subject as well The definition of the 
species (οι man) and that of the genus (or animal) are 
used of an individual man Therefore, substance 1s 
not in a subject 

That they cannot be present in subjects 1s true 
not of substances only but holds of differentiae, too 
Thus we can of the species called “man” asseit 
‘going on foot ’ and two-footed But these are not 
found present init For neither of these 15 77 man 
Where, again, you affirm the differentia, you also 
afhim its definition Suppose of the species called 
“man you should predicate ‘ gomg on foot’ The 
definition also of that attribute then will apply to 
that species Foi‘ man does, indeed, go on foot 

That the parts of the substances are present o1 
found in the wholes as in subjects 15 a fact that need 
hardly disturb us or render us fearful of havmg to 
biand all such parts as no substances Did we not 
qualify ‘ present in a subject by ‘ not as the parts

Differentia and substance alike have this charac- 
tcristicin common that, wherever we predicate them, 
we predicate them univocally For such propositions 
have always individuals οἱ species ἔοι subjects The 
primary substance, no doubt, being never predicated 
ot anything, neve1 itself can be predicate of any pro- 
poution whatever Not so with the secondary sub- 
stince The species is predicated of all individual 
examples, the genus of these and the species And 
so with differentiae also Of species and individuals 
we predicate these τὰ hike manner Both definitions, 
moreover, or those of the genus and species, apply to 
the primary substance and that of the genus to the 
specics For all we affirm of the predicate will also 
be affirmed of the subject The defimtion of each 
differentia applies in a similar manner to both indi- 
viduals and species But, as we have already noticed, 
univocal 1s used of such things as not only possess 
the same name but are also defined the same way 
Hence it follows that in all propositions having sub- 
stance or difference for predicate that predicate 1s 
quite unequivocal 

All substance appears individual And this 1s 
indisputably true in the case of the primary sub- 
stance, What each denotes is a unit In that of 
the secondary substances language may make it 
appear so, as when we say animal, man _ This, 
how ever, 1s not really so, for a quality rather 1s meant 
Second substance 1s not one and single, as, no doubt, 
the pumary is, not of one but of many, indeed, do 
we predicate ‘animal,’ ‘man’ Species and genus, 
however, do not merely indicate quality, as ‘ white’ 
merely indicates quality Accidents, that 1s, hke

man as compaied with himself οἱ another This man

or less white than another white object may be or, 
again, as one beautiful object has more or less beauty 
than others The same quality in the same object 
may vary at times in degree For example, a

substance, itis For a manis not more of a man than 
he was at some time in the past And so of all 
substances else Therefore, substance can have no 
degrees 

But whatis most characteristic of substance appears 
to be this that, although it remains, notwithstand- 
ing, numerically one and the same, 1t 15 capable of 
being the recipient of contrary qualifications Of 
things that are other than substance we could hardly 
adduce an example possessed of this characteristic 
For instance, a particular colour, numerically one and 
the same, can 1n no wise be both black and white, and 
an action, if one and the same, can in no wise be 
both good and bad So of everything other than 
substance But substance, remaining the same, yet 
admits of such contrary qualities One and the same 
individual at one time is white, warm or good, at 
anothe: time blach, cold or bad This is not so with 
anything else, though τὸ mght be maintained that 
assertions or opmions admitted of contraries That 
is to say, the same statement may appeai to be 
both true and false? ‘He sits’ may, for instance, 
be true If he mses, 1t then becomes false And 
so with opimons as well One may be of opmion, 
and truly, that such or such person is sitting 
And yet, when that person has risen, that opmion, 
if held still, is false Even though we allow 
this exception, 1t would differ, in fact, from the rest 
in its manner of coming about For whenever a 
substance admits of such contrary qualifications, 1t 1s 
by achange initself Itis by a change im itself that 
a thing that was hot becomes cold (having passed 
fiom one state to another) or a thing that was white 
becomes black or a thing that was good becomes bad

4nd so, too, in all other cases where substance admits 
of such qualities The statement or opimon, how- 
ever, 1¢mains in itself quite unaltered in any and 
every respect Ifit takes on the contrary quality, 
bemg now true and now false, then the facts of the 
case will have changed For the statement ‘he 
sits’ 1s unchanged, but according to existing con- 
ditions we call it now true and now false As with 
statements, so, too, with opmmons In its manner, 
then, of coming about 1115 1eally peculiar to substance 
to admit of the conti a1 y qualities—to wit, by a change 
in itself 

If a man, then, should make an exception in favour 
of opinions and statements, maintaming that these 
admit also of contrary qualifications, his view would, 
intiuth,be unsound If opimions and statements are 
said to admit of such qualifications, the fact 1s that 
not they themselves but that something else undeigoes 
change ἴοι it 1s by the tacts of the case, by their 
being or not being so, that a statement 1s called true 
οἱ false Itis not that the statement itself can admit 
of such contiary qualities For nothing, in one word, 
can alter the nature of opinions and statements, and, 
seeing no change occurs in them, they cannot admit 
of such contraties But substance admits of such 
contraries by having received them itself 1 alter- 
nately takes to itself health, disease, whiteness, 
blackness, the hhe By receiving them into itself 
is 1t said to admit of such contraizies So, to conclude, 
we may call this above all distinctive of substance, 
that, remaining still one and the same, 1t may yet 
through a change im itself receive contrary quali- 
fications Let so much on substance suffice

Again time and space aie continuous Time 15 a 
whole ind continuous, the present, past, future are 
linked Space 1s also this kind of a quantity For 
sceing the puts of a solid themselves occupy so 
much space and these parts have a limit in common, 
it follows the parts of space also, which those paits 
themselves occupy, have exactly the same common 
limit οἱ term as the parts of the sohd ΑΒ 1s time, so 
1s space, then, continuous the paits meet at one 
common boundary 

All quantities are made up of parts, and those 
parts as we saw, have position in reference one to 
another or else they have no such position The 
paits of a line, for example, must all have their 
relative places Each without doubt, must he some- 
mhere, and each can be clearly distinguished You 
can say where each lies on the plane and to what 
suit of pait it τὰ next So the parts of the plane 
have position again you can say where each hes 
and to what sort of paitsitis next This 1s true, too, 
of sohds and spice But the case of a number 1s 
different You never could show that its puts are 
possessed of thar relative places οἱ even so much 
ashaveplaces Nor could you determine which parts

may be sud of time also Fo. no part of time 1s 
enduing And how can what docs not endure well 
be said to have any position? Of time it were bettei 
to say that the parts have a relative onde, since one

number, for numbers are prior in the counting, as 
one p1loi to two, two to three Thus of number also

The things we have mentioned alone can be called 
in the strictest sense quantities Other things that 
are so called are so called in a secondary sense—with 
an eye to some one of the former To take an 
example ortwo <A white objectis often called laige, 
since the surface 1t covers 15 large, an action or pro- 
cess called long, since the time that 1t occupies 1s long 
The name ‘ quantity ’ cannot be given to such things 
as of then own night Someone asks you ἡ how long 
was that action?’ You mention the time that 1t 
tooh, as ‘it lasted a year or the hke Someone 
asks you ‘how large is that white thing?’ You 
mention the sufaceit covers As large as the surface 
it coveis, so large, you will say, that white object 
The things, then, refered to alone in themselves can 
be stuictly called quantities, other things thus desig- 
nated can only lay claim to that name, if at all, ina 
secondary sense—in a sort of derivative fashion and 
not from their intrinsic nature 

Quant ties never have contraries This will be 
perfectly clear in the case of all definite quantities, 
whereby I mean for example, ‘two cubits’ or 
‘ three cubits long or a surface or something of that 
soit These, it is clear, have no contraries But 
possibly someone may say, great and ‘small,’ 
‘much ’ and ‘little’ are contraries These are, how-

by compazison only Thus a hill is called small, a 
oan lirge, but we 1eally mean greater or smaller 
than similar things of the lind, for we look to some 
extanal standard If such terms were used ab- 
solutely, we nevei should call a hill small, as we never 
should call a grain large So, again, we may ve1y 
well say that a village Nae many ahabitadts. a eity 
hike Athens but few , though the latter are many times 
moire, or we say that a house contains many, while 
those nm the theatre are few, though they greatly 
outnumbei the others While ‘ two cubits,’ ‘ thee 
cubits long and the like, therefore, ugmfy quantity, 
‘great,’ small’ and the hike sigmfy not a quantity 
but rather a relation, implying some exteinal stand ird 
οἱ something above and beyond them The latter, 
then, plainly are relative 

Quantities, moreovel, or not, there is nothing that 
is contiary to them Fo. what 1s not grasped by 
itself but refered to some external standad—how 
suppose that can have any contrary * Secondly, sup- 
pose we allow “ gieat and ‘small’ and the lhe to be 
contraiies, then the same subject, 1t follows, at one 
and the same time admits of the contrary qualifica- 
tions and things to themselves will be contrary Does 
it not sometimes occur that the same thing 1s both 
great and small? As compared with one thing, 1t 1s 
small, χ 1s great, as compaied with anothe: And 
so the same thing simultaneously comes to be both 
gieat and small or at one and the same time admits 
of the contiary qualifications But in dealing with 
substance we stated that nothing can thus “sumul- 
taneously admit of such quahfications Substance, 
no doubt, 1s 1eceptive of contrary qualifications, but 
not in such way that a man at the same time 15 both

sick and healthy, a thing black and white simul- 
taneously Neithcr can anything else be at any time 
thus qualified Then,if great,’ ‘small’ and so forth 
were contrary these to themselves would be contrary 
Grantcd for argument’s sake both that ἡ gieat ἦ15 the 
contrary of ‘small’ and that one and the same thing 
can be at the same moment both great and small, 

gieat’ or ‘small’ to itself will be contrary This 
is, however, impossible nothing to itself can be con- 
trary Therefore, we cannot describe ‘ great’ and 
‘small’ ‘ much’ and ‘little’ as contraries Neither 
could such terms have contraries, even though some- 
one should call them terms not of relation but of 
quantity 

In dealing with space, the contention that quantity 
admits of a contrary seems to have most plausibility 
‘ Above’ and ‘ below ’ are called contraries, when by 
‘below ’ what 1s meant 1s the region or space at the 
eentie This use is, however, de1ived fiom the view 
that we take of the world, since it 1s at the extremities 
of the world that the distance from the centre 1s the 
greatest * Indeed, in defining αἰΐ contraries, we seem 
to have space in oui minds For we call those things 
contrary which, being also within the same class, are 
most distant the one from the other 

Quantities do not appear to admit of a more and 
aless For example, take ‘two cubits long Now, 
this nevei admits of gradations A thing 1s not two 
cubits long in a gieater degree than another And 
so, m like manner, of numbers One three 15 not, 
so to speak, three in a greater degree than another ,

« Aristotle here classihes as relatives two distinct classes 
of terms, those said to be of other things’ and those said 
‘to be tow αἱ ds something else’ (ad uleguid) in some other 
manner’ He means by the former all terms with a genitive 
dependent upon them This distinction cannot be brought 
out in the sime concise manner in English There 1s no 
single form that will cover all the uses of the genitive in 
Greek The (rreeh genitive for mstance, expresses not 
only our ‘of but our ‘ than’

CATEGORIRES, vi-vir 


quantity mentioned can a ‘more’ or a ‘less’ be 
affirmed The category, therefore, of quantity in no 
wise admits of degrees 

What 15 really pecuhar to quantities is that we 
compare or contiast them in terms οἱ on grounds of 
equality We predicate ‘ equal,’ ‘ unequal,’ of all 
of the quantities mentioned One solid 1s equal to 
another, another, per contra, unequal We use these 
terms also of time mm compaiing the peiiods of 1t 
So also of all other quantities that we have previously 
mentioned Of nothing, moieover, save quantities 
can we affirm these two terms For we neve) say 
this disposition 1s “ equal’ to that or “ unequal’ We 
say itis lhe’ on ‘unlike’ One quality—whuiteness, 
for unstance—is never compared with another in 
terms or on grounds of equahty Such things are 
termed ‘hhe and‘ unhke Thus ou: calling some- 
thing ‘equal, “ unequal,’ 1s the mark, above all marks, 
of quantity 

VII Let us now turn to Relation We call a thing 
relative, when it 1s said to be such as 1¢ 18 fiom its 
beng of some othe: thing οἱ, if not, fiom its 
being related to something im some other way 2 
Thus ‘the gieate: 15 said to be greater by 1efer- 
ence to something outside 1t For, indeed, when 
we call a thing ᾿ gieater, we mean by that gieater 
than something ‘The double’ 15 called what it 15 
fiom its being the double ofsomething For‘ double’ 
means double of something And so with all terms 
of that hind Other relatives also there are, such as 
habit, disposition, perception, position or attitude, 
knowledge All these are explained by a reference to 
something to which they belong, and in no other way

whatsoever A habit is a habit of something, know- 
ledge is knowledge of something, position position 
of something We speak, then, of relative terms, 
when a thing’s being such as it 15 1s explained by a 
genitive following οἱ else by some phiase or expres- 
sion designed to bring out the relation For instance, 
we call a hill ‘large, meaning large as compared 
with another By such a comparison only 1t 1s that 
a hillis called ‘large So we call a thing simular,’ 
‘hhe ’“—‘ hke’ or ‘ similar’ ἐο something else [ 1s 
thus with all terms ofthat nature This also we notice 
m passing while lying and standing and sitting are 
really specific positions, position itself is a relative 
To he and to stand and to sit, these are not them- 
selyes 1eally positions, their names aie, however, 
derived fiom the attitudes just now referred to 

Relatives sometimes have contraries Virtue 1s 
contiary to vice, eithe: teim itself bemg a relative , 
hnowledge to ignoiance also By no means all 
relative terms can, however, be said to have con- 
traries ‘Double and tiple’ have none, nor, 
indeed, any terms of that soit 

Relatives also, 1t seems, may admit of degrees in 
some cases, as ‘like,’ ‘ unlike,’ ‘ equal, ‘ unequal,’ 
which all may have ‘more or ‘less’ added, while 
each is arelative term Tor by ‘hke’ we mean hke 
something else and by unlike’ unhke something 
else Itis not the case, nevertheless, that all relatives 
admit of degiees We do not say more’ or ‘less 
double,’ and so with all terms of that kind 

All relatives have thei coirelatives ‘Slave’ 
means the slave of a master, and ‘ master,’ in turn, 
implies slave ‘Double means double its half, just 
as half’ means the half ofits double By ‘ greater,’

say, what 1s 1uddei:ed is ruddered by means of its 
rudder So also in all othe: cases A head will be 
better defined as correlative of that which 1s ‘ headed,’ 
not, loosely, as head of an animal Animals, simply 
as inimals, do not have heads of necessity Many, 
indeed, have no heads We may thus, I think, best 
understand to what this or that thing 1s 1elated, where 
no name at present exists, 1f we take the thing having 
a name and then, coming another name from it, 
apply it to the former’s correlative Just as we coined 
‘winged’ and ‘ruddered’ above from the names 
“wing ’ and ‘ 1udder 
Thus ill relatives are referred to their correlates, 
provided they are rightly defined I must add this 
proviso because, if the correlate happens to be stated 
mn casual, inaccurate fashion, the terms cannot well 
be reciprocal Let me explain what Imean Even 
where the mght names do exist and the things are 
admittedly co1elates, no correlation appears, when 
we give one of these two a name that in no way brings 
out the relation and has some irrelevant meaning 
Let ‘slave’ be defined im ielation to ‘man’ or to 
biped ᾿ οἱ what not, instead of its being defined (as 
it should be) by 1eference to master,’ then no cor- 
relation appears, for the 1efe1 ence 1s really maccurate 
Again, let us grant that two things are correlative 
one with another and that the correct term is uscd 
for the purpose of stating the second Although we 
remove all its other—I mean, its unelevant—attrni- 
butes, leaving that only in virtue of which it was 
ealled the correlative, then will the said correlation 
be, none the less, found to exist The conelative of 
‘slave, for example, is properly said to be ‘ master ’

‘receptive ot knowledge ’ or “ human,’ and leave but 
his being ‘a master,’ then ‘slave’ will be still the 
eorclatie, ‘slave meanmg slave of a master 

On the other hand, let us suppose one conelative 
nimed incorrectly Then, if we strip off its attiu- 
bates swing that only in vitue of which it was called 
a eouelative, all correlation will vanish Let ‘a 
slave’ be defined as ‘a mans , let ‘a wing’ be 
defined 1s ‘a bird’s’ Take the attribute ‘ master’ 
fiom‘ man’ then indeed, the correlation subsisting 
betwcen‘ man’ and‘ slave willhavevamshed No 
master, 1n short, then no slave Take the attribute 
‘winged from ‘the bnd’ Then the wing will no 
mole bearelative nought will there now be a wing 
of, the bund being no longer winged 

And so, to sum up we must state all correlative 
terms with exactness Ifa name 1s already to hand, 
then the statement will piove to be easy If no 
name already exists, then I thmkh it our duty to 
coin one It 15 clear, when the names are correct, 
that all relative terms are correlative 

Conrelatives are commonly held to come into evist- 
ence togethe1, and this for the most part is tiue, as, 
for instance, of double and half That a half exists 
means that the double of which it 1s half must exist 
The existence of a master involves the existence also 
of a slave If a slave exists, then must a master 
And so in all similar eases Moreover, this holds of 
them also to cancel one cancels the other For 
instance, no double, no half, and, per contra, no half, 
then no double and so with all similar terms 
However, the view that coirelatives come into being 
together does not appeai true at all times, for αὐ

seems that the object of Lnowledge is prioi to, exusts 
befoie, knowledge We gain knowledge, commonly 
speaking, of things that already exist, fo. m very 
few cases or none cin our Lnowledge have come into 
being along with its own proper object 

Should the object of knowledge be 1emoved, 
then the knowledge itsclf will be cancelled The 
converse of this 1s not tiue If the object no 
longer exists, there can no longei be any hnowledge, 
there being now nothing to know If, howevei, of 
this or that object no knowledge has yet been 
aequued, yet that object itself may exist Take 
the squaring of the circle, ἔοι mstance, if that can 
be called such an object Although it exists as 
an object, the knowledge does not yct exist It all 
animals ceased to exist, there would then be no know- 
ledge at all, though there might m that case, not- 
withstanding, be still many objects of knowledge 

The same may be 5816 οἵ perception Theobject, I 
mean, would appeai tobe prior to the act of perception

theperceptionas well Takeaway o11emove the pei-

of perception imphes or involves, first, a body per-

ἔοι the body itself 1s perceptible And, body not 
being existent, perception must cease to exist Tahe 
away the perceptible, then, and you take away also 
peiception But the taking away of perception does 
not take such objects away If the animal itself 15 
destroyed, then perception 1s alsodestroyed But pei-

Perception, further, comes into being along with 
the subject percer,ing—that 1s, with the live thing 
itself The perceptible, however, 1s prior to the 
animal and to perception For such things as wate1 
and fire, out of which are composed living beings, 
exist before any such beings and prior to all acts 
of perception The perceptible, so we conclude, 
would appear to be prior to perception 

The view that no substance 1s relative—a view that 
is commonly held—would appear to be open to 
question Exception, perhaps, should be made in 
the case of some secondaiy substances Doubtless, 
the view we refer to holds good of the primary sub- 
stance, for neither the wholes nor the parts of fist 
substances ever 816 relative This man or that ox, 
for example, 1s never defined with a reference to 
something beyond or outside And the same also 
holds of then parts Thus a certain hand or hed 1s 
not said to be a certain hand of someone οἱ othcr, a 
certain head of someone or other We call them 
the hand and the head of this specified person 01 that 
50, too, with the secondary substances, at least with 
the vast generality Species, ike man,’ ‘ox andso 
forth, are never defined with a reference to something 
beyond or outside them Neither 1s ‘wood’ so 
defined, and, τῇ wood 1s 1.egarded as relative, then 1s 
it so as a property, belonging to someone or other, and 
not nits character of wood It 1s evident, then, in 
such cases that substance can hardly be 1elative 
Opinions, however, may differ im the case of some 
secondary substances Thus we define head and 
‘hand’ in the lhght of the wholes they belong to, 
and so these might seem to be relative Indeed, it 
would prove very hard, not to say an rmpossible task,

thus to show that zo substance is relative, if we 
eoricctly defined what was meant by a relative term 
On the othe: hand if we were wrong, 1f those things 
are true relatives only, whose very existence con- 
cists In their being in some way or other related to 
some other object, then something, I think, might be 
sud The former definition applies to al] relatives 
beyond any doubt, but the fact that a thing 1s 
explained by a reference to something outside it 1s 
not the same thing as to say that 1t 1s of neccssity 
relative @ 

From what we have said thisis plam if a relative 
is definitely Lnown, that to which it 1s relative also 
will then be as definitely Lnown What is moire, we 
mav call this self-evident Provided, that is, that 
you know a particular thing to be relative, relatives 
being those objects whose very existence consists in 
then being in some way or other related to some other 
thing, then you know what that other thing 1s to 
which that thing itselfis related Fon 1f you did not 
know at all that to which 1t 1s somehow ielated, you 
could not so much as know whether it was οἱ it 
δὰ ποῦ arelative Take some particula: instances , 
then will the point be quite clear For suppose that 
you definitely know a particular thing to be‘ double’, 
then at once will you definitely know also that thing 
of which 1t 1s double You cannot know that 1t 1s 
double zzthout knowing that 1t 15 double of something 
specific and definte Again, if you definitely hnow 
a particular thing is more beautiful, at once must 
you definitely know that than which it 1s reckoned 
more beautiful Thus you will not vaguely know that 
puticular thing has more beauty than something 
possessing less beauty For that would be mere
