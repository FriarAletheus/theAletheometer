Heidegger's "Contributions to Philosophy," navigates through profound and complex terrain laid out in the thematic sections Heidegger terms "joinings." Each joining presents its own unique philosophical inquiry and contributes to a cohesive understanding of Heidegger's exploration of being and truth.

In the Author's Preface, Heidegger sets the stage for a departure from traditional philosophical method, preparing the reader for the unique journey ahead.

The First Joining focuses on the themes of silence, reservedness, and the form of thinking that's authentic to being. It emphasizes the act of leaping into enowning, suggesting an active, non-representational engagement in the search for truth.

The Second Joining delves into the transformation of thinking in relation to being, introducing terms like 'jointure,' 'echo,' 'playing-forth,' and 'leap,' which highlight the interconnectedness in the progression of thought during the epoch of crossing.

In the Third Joining, Heidegger elaborates on "The Leap" as a pivotal transition to being-history, which requires leaving behind the familiar and embarking on a distinct historical domain — a move characterized by risk yet rooted in deep awe.

"The Last God" joining concludes the series by contemplating the enigmatic presence of the last god, whose sway is defined by subtlety and divine nuances within the tapestry of being. It suggests a complete surrender to and reception of being, where the most profound truths are celebrated quietly in fidelity and simplicity.

Each joining builds upon the previous ones, with the ideas intertwining to present a rich tapestry of philosophical thought. They collectively illustrate Heidegger's departure from traditional philosophical narrative, offering a poetic and performative mode of engaging with complex existential questions. They are not distinct silos of thought but rather tendrils of a single philosophical organism that seeks to express the esoteric and profound nature of being, truth, and time.

the first joining:

The first joining in Heidegger's "Contributions to Philosophy" dives into the theme of silence, reticence, and the language of thinking as it is,"ennowned" or brought forth by being. Heidegger expands on the nature of grounding-question and guiding-question, illustrating how the essence of philosophical inquiry lies not in assertion or principle but in the reservedness and necessity of decision stemming from the truth of distress. The poetic and evocative language reflects an emphasis on the reservedness that comes to word through enowning.

To truly grasp what is being conveyed, Heidegger suggests that one must engage in the projecting-open and execute the leap into enowning, emphasizing the non-representational nature of thinking-questioning. He stresses that meaning is only accessed as Da-sein, meaning there in thinking-questioning.

Heidegger posits that seeking is already a holding-oneself within the truth, an originary relation to the hesitating refusal, signaling that the genuine seeker has already found what they are seeking, not after the search ends but within the very act of searching itself. This ties back to the essence of questioning as a form of staying and inabiding.

The overall tone and style of the section are characteristic of Heidegger's attempt to infuse his philosophy with a sense of poetic conceptualization, breaking away from the traditional analytic or explanatory methods of philosophy. The language is intentionally dense and nuanced, inviting the reader to participate actively in thinking rather than passively consuming concepts or arguments. This method of inquiry and exposition is meant to reflect the complex and subterranean nature of the philosophical issues at hand, resonating with Heidegger's themes of looking beneath the surface, listening to the silence, and engaging with the reticence of the ownmost truth.

the second joining:

In the second joining of Heidegger's "Contributions to Philosophy," the focus intensifies on the nature of thinking in relation to being, elucidating the terms like 'jointure,' 'echo,' 'playing-forth,' and 'leap.' Heidegger ties these concepts to the process of understanding and decision-making within the presence of the 'epoch of the crossing.'

He emphasizes that in this epoch, the work of thinking must take the form of a pathway that is both a journey and a means in itself, highlighting the dual aspect of 'going' and the 'way' as intrinsic to the nature of thought. The joining is articulated through a network of related concepts that push the reader to recognize the interconnectedness and the unfolding process of thinking.

Heidegger's style in this section continues to bend away from conventional linear argumentation. His prose maintains a poetic density, favoring a style that foregrounds the simultaneous concealment and revelation in the expression of being. This is evident when he discusses the transformative impact of words and their capacity to either disclose or hide the essence of being.

The passage suggests that every articulation of being is expressed through words and names, which are traditionally understood in everyday contexts. However, these words have the capacity to be reinterpreted or 'enjoined' in the deep exploration of being's truth. The prosaic style is crafted to challenge the reader to navigate this conceptual landscape; it insists on an active engagement where the true meaning is not just discovered but enacted through the interplay of language, thinking, and being.

Thus in this section, Heidegger does more than present philosophical ideas. His illustrative method invites the reader into a dynamic and transformative experience of philosophical inquiry, where one must actively participate in thinking to unravel the profound insights on the nature of being, the role of language, and the transformative potential within the epoch of the crossing.

the third joining:

The third joining in Heidegger's "Contributions to Philosophy" is focused on the concept of "The Leap." This leap is described as the most daring move in the transition from inceptual thinking to a greater form of understanding. It represents an abandonment of the familiar and an expectation of nothing immediate from beings, instead releasing a belongingness to be-ing in its full essential sway as enowning. The leap therefore appears reckless yet is precisely attuned by deep awe[1].

Heidegger characterizes being-history as a departure from the familiar, suggesting that it's not about entering an unexperienced period but rather a totally different domain of history. The end of what he calls the first beginning may still affect this transition but does not define it. The being-history recognizes moments of exceptional enowning, which include the allotment of truth to be-ing, the collapse of truth, and the abandonment of beings by being. In this historical context, destruction of the existing world screams triumphs into the void while be-ing gathers its highest calling: to own the domain of decision of the godhood of gods and the free-play of time-space, which is Da-sein[2].

The style and method continue to reflect Heidegger's characteristic prose, which stresses the dramatic transition from a known to an unknown form of engagement with being and history. The act of "going-under" gathers greatness in preparation for the truth of the uniqueness and one-time-ness of be-ing. It is the innermost nearness to refusal, where enowning gifts itself to humans. This deep and evocative language seeks to invoke not just a conceptual understanding but an existential resonance with the crossing into new realms of experience and thought[3].

the fourth joining:

The fourth joining of Heidegger's "Contributions to Philosophy," designated as "Grounding," addresses the concept of Da-sein, which can only be spoken of as grounding, being enacted through the thinking of 'Echo,' 'Playing-Forth,' and 'Leap.' Heidegger implies grounding to be inherently historical and directed towards our future history, deeply connected with inner distress (abandonment of being) and the out-springing necessity of the grounding-question[1].

This self-joining prepares the site for a moment of crucial decision, constituting the law for the progression of thought in the commencement of something other than the historical end of the first beginning. The fourth joining distinguishes itself from any systemization that characterized the previous epoch, indicating a shift in the structure and methodology of thought[2].

In discussing "domains" such as nature and history, Heidegger suggests a necessary projecting-open that aligns with being, to experience these domains anew. He warns that this crossing is risky and could lead to a reversion to old systematic methods. However, when order constitutes a joining that is subjected to the formation of history and carrying out its mystery, it must inherently possess a domain and pathway. He emphasizes that sheltering always involves the strife of world and earth, and that this strife heightens and infuses the other, with the sheltering of truth chiefly occurring in their counter-current. Consequently, the world is described as "earthy," belonging to the earth[3].

Heidegger's prose continues to present a complex intertwinement of existential concepts, with grounding being not only a foundation for Da-sein but also for future history's distress and necessity. The term "earthy" again reinforces his unique, illustrative method in discussing the foundational aspects of being, illustrating the connection between world, earth, and truth, and how these elements interact in the zenith of thought and existence.

the fifth joining:

The fifth joining in Heidegger's "Contributions to Philosophy," titled "The Ones to Come," deals with the future custodians of the essential sway of truth. These are the individuals who patiently listen and establish the grounding of this truth, those who withstand the force of being (Be-ing). "The Ones to Come" are expected from the future, as they will experience both the distancing and nearing of the 'last god'【0†source】.

Heidegger indicates that preparation for "The Ones to Come" is required, and inceptual thinking serves as this preparation through silent reticence of enowning. However, thinking is presented as only one of the ways that the few may venture the leap into being. Echo, playing-forth, leap, and grounding, all have their own guiding-attunement, which together originate from within the grounding-attunement【0†source】.

This section continues the recurring theme of preparing for a more profound engagement with truth beyond what is immediately apparent. Heidegger's language remains dense and requires a reflective approach to grasp the deeper import. The preparation mentioned here is not just intellectual but also existential, where the future thinkers, "The Ones to Come," are imbued with the responsibility of maintaining the truth of being within the tumult and change of history. These custodians are described as strangers of like mind, tasked with upholding the essence of being through their adherence to gifting and refusing what has been given to them. They epitomize the silent witness to truth, providing a shelter for what is most sheltered, suggesting a role that rescues the essential from the clamor and confusion of 'calculated correctness'【1†source】.

the final joining:

In the final joining of Heidegger's "Contributions to Philosophy," dedicated to "The Last God," Heidegger explores the enigmatic presence of the last god whose sway is deeply rooted in the hint, both the onset and staying away of arrival, as well as the departure of previous gods, all occurring within a sheltered and hidden transformation. The last god is not synonymous with enowning, but rather it depends on enowning, which is associated with the founder of the there [Da-gründer][1].

"The Last God" introduces a state of utmost abandonment for a being, brought about by the hint of enowning. This state is further elaborated as a deep intertwining of love and death into a fidelity to god, resisting the confusion of the truth of beings. Those who are to come and are associated with the last god will remind themselves of the profound truth of the enfilled once and uniqueness of being. Adjacent to such profundity, the trivial preoccupations will be rendered obsolete, potentially giving way to a time post-gods where beings who are "world-poor" might default to exploitation of the earth[2].

Heidegger posits that reservedness and reticence in silence will form the core celebration of the last god. The acolytes of the last god will find in themselves a way to entrust the simplicity, suggesting a profound and almost mystical engagement with the essence of being. This perspective compels a reflection on the convergence of existence and non-existence, the intimate dance between what reveals itself and what remains hidden, fostering a serene reverence for the simplicity that lies at the heart of complexity[3].

This synthesis of ideas culminates in a vision of the last god as the final gathering point for the profundity of Heidegger's philosophical expedition; it marks a place of utmost surrender and reception to being where the greatest truths of existence are celebrated in the quietude of fidelity and simplicity.
