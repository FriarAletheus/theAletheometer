Summary: Heidegger’s philosophical inquiry in "What is a Thing?" delves into the complexities of defining 'things' beyond their everyday and scientific appearances. The discussion advances through a contemplation of various themes such as the nature of truth, the influence of historical understanding, the philosophical significance of predicates and properties, and the relationship between language and being.

Heidegger differentiates between the tangible 'things' we encounter and their metaphysical essence. He scrutinizes not only the methodological approaches of philosophy and science but also the historical consciousness which motivates our current thinking.

He introduces the notion that truth and essence are not immutable but instead are subject to the ambience of space and time, and further, are influenced by our own historical perspectives. Heidegger emphasizes the active, decision-making role of philosophical inquiry, which demands careful thought and commitment to questioning.

Critique: While Heidegger's approach is compelling in its depth and scope, it may encounter critiques for its seeming esoteric nature and the difficulty of applying such philosophical considerations to the practical plane. His extensive interrogation of commonly accepted truths may resonate with some as overly intricate, potentially distancing those who prefer more pragmatic outlooks.

Alignment with Taoist Thought: Taoism, an ancient Chinese philosophy and religion, emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao, or "the Way," understood as the fundamental, unnameable process of reality. Heidegger's contemplative style and emphasis on the intrinsic link between beings and their ontological ground find some resonance in Taoist thought.

The Taoist perspective eschews rigid conceptualizations in favor of grasping the ineffable nature of reality. Heidegger's exploration of the essence of things aligns with this Taoist sense of underlying unity, which cannot be fully expressed or grasped through conventional language or thought—similar to Laozi’s Tao Te Ching’s opening lines that the Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.

Heidegger's emphasis on the importance of history and context as shaping one's understanding of being finds a parallel in Taoism's emphasis on understanding the flow of change within nature and aligning oneself with it. However, Taoism places less focus on historical consciousness and more on direct experience and intuition in grasping the nature of reality.

The critique of viewing things merely as objects with properties aligns with the Taoist view that names and concepts, while useful, are ultimately limited. The Taoist doctrine of wu wei, or non-action, embodies a naturalness and spontaneity that contrasts with the over-reliance on structure and definition—a sentiment echoed in Heidegger’s critique of the material thing as the common ground for all things.

In conclusion, while Heidegger’s philosophy is more analytical and rooted in Western metaphysical thought than Taoism, there are complementary threads. Both philosophies encourage seeing beyond surface appearances and conventional definitions to touch upon a deeper reality that unifies all things. However, Taoism advocates for a more intuitive and less conceptual approach, emphasizing harmony with the natural world directly, whereas Heidegger's method is distinctly discursive, historical, and critical.

synopsis

1).

Chapter One appears to focus on the philosophical and scientific questioning of the nature of 'things' and covers various approaches to defining and understanding the concept of a 'thing'. Heidegger addresses confusion and ambiguity around the term by delineating between the narrow sense (tangible, visible objects) and the broader sense (affairs, transactions, occurrences). He also introduces the widest sense of a 'thing' as used in the philosophy of the 18th century by Kant, who differentiates between the 'thing-in-itself' (noumenon) and 'thing-for-us' (phenomenon).

Key themes and concepts in Chapter One include:

    The difficulty of philosophical inquiry compared to the more direct approach of science.
    Housemaids laughing anecdote, illustrating the common perception of philosophy as impractical or disconnected from everyday life.
    Metaphysics mentioned as the core of philosophy, not simply another branch like ethics or logic.
    The term 'thing' is used in varying contexts and connotations, from physical objects to abstract concepts and even to affairs of life reflecting German usage of the word.

Heidegger seems to set up an exploration into the nature of entities while simultaneously critiquing the tendency to oversimplify philosophical inquiry into mere scholastic endeavors.

The goal seems to be to question and understand the essence of 'things' beyond everyday experiences and perceptions, bearing in mind the distinction between the immediate, tangible reality and the underlying nature of reality that philosophy seeks to uncover.

2).

Chapter Two delves into the complexity of defining what a 'thing' is and emphasizes the distinction between 'thing-in-itself' and 'thing-for-us'. It reiterates the multitude of meanings for the term 'thing', acknowledging both tangible objects and intangible concepts, decisions, actions, and historical events.

Heidegger points out that determining the boundaries of what can be termed as a 'thing' is arbitrary and subject to the context of the question at hand. He proposes to focus on things in their most immediate and tangible sense.

Key concepts and insights from Chapter Two include:

    The ambiguity of the term 'thing' and the challenge of questioning it without prior clarification.
    An outline of three different meanings of 'thing': concrete objects, inclusive of intangible entities, and anything that is 'something' rather than nothing.
    The limitation of scientific and technical methods in answering philosophical questions, as these methods address the practical aspects of things, not their essence as 'things'.
    The idea that philosophical inquiry might look to grasp the 'thingness' or the unconditioned aspect of things, which cannot be experienced in the same way as concrete objects or measured by scientific inquiry.

This chapter sets up a philosophical investigation beyond the realm of empirical evidence and conventional understanding, leaning towards the metaphysical and existential dimensions of reality.

3).

In the ensuing chapter, Heidegger continues to examine the question "What is a thing?" by exploring the everyday and scientific experiences of things and the nature of truth in these contexts. He draws attention to the discrepancy between our everyday understanding of things, which are always encountered as particular instances, and the scientific perspective that abstracts and generalizes.

Key insights from this chapter include:

    The caution that while science and technical skill are not to be dismissed, they have limitations and are not necessarily equipped to explore the philosophical essence of things.
    An examination of the tension between our ordinary experiences of things and scientific formulations, using examples such as the shepherd's sun versus the astrophysicist's sun, and the everyday table versus the scientifically analyzed table.
    The acknowledgment that both perspectives may hold truth, but it raises the question of what constitutes truth and how it is determined.
    The suggestion that a different kind of truth or understanding may be needed to reconcile the two views, one that encompasses the particular and the abstract.

Heidegger indicates that decisions, such as understanding the nature of a thing, are not made simply by discussing them but through engaging with situations where such decisions become critical, even if they appear irrelevant to daily life or scientific inquiry. He posits that the pursuit of understanding the essence of a thing involves engaging with the decisions and questions that seem impractical or detached from everyday concerns.

With this continuing exploration of the nature of 'thingness', Heidegger constructs an environment where the reader is urged to consider the philosophical weight behind our interaction with the world, emphasizing a knowledge that is distinct from both empirical science and personal worldviews.

Chapter Four expands on the intricacies of the concept of a "thing" and introduces the elemental roles of space and time in defining the uniqueness of things. Heidegger discusses how every tangible thing is singular, unique, and characterized by its "thisness" or particularity.

Key concepts and insights from this chapter include:

    The notion that no 'thing' exists generically or in general; each is particular, with no two exactly alike.
    The discussion that even things that seem identical, such as pine needles, are differentiated by space and time; they occupy different places or exist at different times, leading to their individual distinctiveness.
    Heidegger's assertion that the particularity of things is grounded in the essence of space and time, suggesting that understanding a 'thing' necessitates grappling with the nature of space and time as well.
    The conceptual exploration of 'Zeitraum', which means time-span, as a term indicating the inner unity of space and time. Heidegger proposes that time might play a special role in the unity of space and time.
    Consideration of whether space and time are merely external frames applied to things or whether they are intricately bound to the essence of things themselves, which contrasts with Descartes' view that space is an extension of the body.

Heidegger implies that the distinctiveness of a thing, its "being-this-one," is not just due to external coordinates but is something more essential, rooted in the interplay of space and time.

5).

Chapter Five deepens the discussion on the singularity of things, exploring Leibniz's principle of the identity of indiscernible things, and considers the Christian theological perspective of being as creation by God.

Key concepts and insights from Chapter Five:

    The Individuality of Things: Heidegger reflects on Leibniz's principle – that there are no two identical things (principium identitatis indiscernibilium) because this would imply a repetition in God's creation. This raises fundamental questions about the essence of being and the ultimate nature of things.

    Theological Argument for Uniqueness: Heidegger recalls the theological concept wherein the being of things is interpreted as their creation by God. The idea that God would not create the same thing twice implies that mechanical repetition contrasts with divine perfection. Therefore, each thing's uniqueness relates to its divine creation.

    Foundations of Being: This chapter alludes to the necessity of reexamining the underlying principles and perceptions of what being generally entails; this exploration may challenge or inform the philosophical discourse about the nature of things and their essence.

    Character of Things as "This One": Heidegger examines whether the singularity of 'things' is determined by space and time or by their very being, hinting that the character of being "just this one" is ultimately intertwined with the question of being itself.

    Demonstratives and Naming: The chapter also considers the role of demonstratives like "this" and "that" in language, noting that while they serve as pronouns in grammar, their essence as exhibiters of things may highlight the connection between language, perception, and the essence of things.

Drawing these strands together, Heidegger continues to entwine elements of language, philosophy, theology, and metaphysics, implicating that understanding the nature of 'things' is not just a philosophical plight but a cross-disciplinary puzzle that encompasses deeper questions about creation, language, and existence.

6).

Chapter Six delves further into the nature of truth concerning things, examining the relationship between truth and the terms "this" and "now".

Key concepts and insights from Chapter Six:

    Interrogation of Everyday Truth: Heidegger investigates what type of truth we hold concerning things in daily experience and questions whether this truth is subjective or objective—or perhaps neither. He considers the drawback of being unable to directly approach things without contemplating the kind of truth in which they stand.

    Space, Time, and the "This": The chapter looks back at determinations such as space, time, and "this", noting their contested belonging to the things themselves. The suspicion is raised that determinations are neither purely objective nor subjective, challenging the established subject-object relationship in philosophy.

    Tenuous Nature of Truth: Heidegger recounts an anecdote involving writing "Here is the chalk" on a paper, which becomes untrue when displaced by a draft. This illustrates the fragility of truth tied to time and location and stimulates a critique on the accepted permanence of truth.

    Relativism and Nihilism: He acknowledges the charges of relativism and nihilism that can arise from asserting the non-permanence of truth, which are heavily criticized in philosophical circles. Heidegger implicitly critiques the practice of philosophy that foregoes thinking for readily available, authoritative answers.

    The Written and Perceived Truth: There's skepticism about the significance of writing the truth as "now" on a blackboard to make it stable. No matter the medium, the statement "Now it is afternoon" will become untrue with the passage of time, illuminating the transient nature of truth tied to time.

This chapter reveals Heidegger's continued effort to deconstruct and challenge our conventional understandings of truth as it pertains to the identity of things. He moves away from objectively defined notions of truth towards a more fluid and situational understanding, while also addressing the philosophical community's resistance to such ideas.

7).

Chapter Seven continues the examination of things, moving from more abstract discussions on space, time, and truth to a more concrete investigation into the structure of things. Heidegger draws from Leibniz's principle, namely the identity of indiscernible things, in discussing that no two things are alike because each is uniquely created by God. He delves into the metaphysical aspect of 'thingness'.

Key themes and concepts from Chapter Seven include:

    Thing's Presence: Heidegger ponders over the changeability of the environment surrounding a thing, such as the chalk in his earlier example, and yet recognizes that the thing remains a discrete entity—always "this one".

    The 'Thisness' and Truth: This chapter touches upon the generality of the "this" in relation to a thing and suggests that the particularity of "this" is intrinsic to its thingness. Heidegger proposes that by taking better care of the truth about things—perhaps enduring the fear of subjectivism—we might get closer to the essence of what things are.

    The Relationship with Space and Time: Heidegger introduces the question of whether the truth concerning a thing merely attaches to it superficially or whether things themselves exist within the truth, much like their existence within space and time.

    Uncovering the Thingness of the Thing: Towards the end of the chapter, there's an exploration of whether the realm of space and time is all that surrounds things or if there's more we can learn from things themselves within this realm.

    Things as Bearer of Properties: A further investigation into the structural composition of things is made, where Heidegger views them as bearers of properties, a nucleus around which properties group themselves. This hints at the stable and enduring essence of things amid their changing characteristics.

The chapter progresses by suggesting that this everyday natural conception is supported by historical philosophical perspectives from Plato to Kant, affirming that things are essentially objects bearing properties.

The transition from understanding the thing's singularity to recognizing its structure as a bearer of properties marks a shift towards a more formative and perhaps tangible grasp of things in Heidegger's exploration.


8).

Chapter Eight confronts the question, "What is a thing?" as an already settled matter, seemingly requiring no further thought or examination, and investigates the essence of truth and the relation it bears to things and propositions.

Key concepts and insights from Chapter Eight:

    Truth as Fitting to Things: The notion that truth is a correspondence with the facts is scrutinized. Heidegger suggests that truth should be understood as fitting to things, a sentiment that echoes his earlier argument about truth's transient nature.

    Essential Structures: The chapter argues for a reflection of the structure of things within the structure of truth. The implication is that if the essence of truth is to fit to things, the essential structure of truth and things should mirror one another.

    Role of Assertions in Truth: Assertions are recognized as the vehicles of truth, and their structure is expounded upon. Heidegger breaks down assertions into proposition, information, communication, and expression. The nature of an assertion's connection to truth is further explored concerning these elements.

    Ambiguity of Assertions: Heidegger indicates that the term "assertion" is ambiguous; an assertion can be an expression, a communication, a statement providing information, or a proposition. He elucidates this with the example of a witness's report in court, emphasizing that various aspects contribute to the truth conveyed by an assertion.

    Asserting as Predicate Assignment: The act of asserting is also connected to the act of ascribing or attributing properties or predicates to a thing. This ties the understanding of truth in propositions back to the understanding of things as the bearers of properties, threading the philosophical inquiry through both language and metaphysics.

Heidegger thus intertwines the essence of truth with the essential structure of things and language, challenging the established perspectives that take the correspondence theory of truth for granted. He redirects the focus to a more nuanced approach, where truth not only corresponds to but fits with the nature of things, highlighted through the structure of assertions.

9).

Chapter Nine focuses on the historicity of our understanding of 'things', questioning the assumed self-evidence of the essence of things as bearers of properties and propositions as bearers of truth.

Key concepts and insights from Chapter Nine:

    Historicity of Definitions: Heidegger asserts that what we take as the 'natural' worldview is historically contingent. He challenges the presumed self-evidence of the definition of things as bearers of properties and propositions as vehicles of truth, and traces their origins back to Plato and Aristotle.

    Historical Assumptions: The chapter posits that these definitions didn't fall 'out of the blue' but were based upon historically specific presumptions. Hence, what is considered 'natural' is not universally self-evident.

    Shifting Perceptions Through Time: Different eras have different perceptions of what is 'natural'. What was natural to the Enlightenment's standard of self-reliant reason was alien to the medieval outlook where 'natural' had divine connotations. Heidegger illustrates how the naturalness of definitions is time-sensitive and dynamic.

    Questioning the Unquestioned: Heidegger challenges the reader to reconsider the unexamined historical foundations that underlie our current conceptualizations of thingness and truth. This retroactive questioning prevents the oversight of taking the essence of things for granted.

    Implications for Today: He suggests that historical conceptions influence how we see and engage with things today. Even though the medieval and classical philosophies might seem distant, their legacy shapes contemporary thought and might obscure our view of the actual characteristics of things.

    Relation to Science and Technology: Heidegger hints at the tension between scientific discovery and the essence of things, such as whether animals and plants investigated scientifically are still recognized as the same beings in their natural environment, or transformed into 'pre-arranged machines'.

    Historical Freedom and Knowledge: Lastly, he points out that historical freedom dictates the level of openness to question existing knowledge. Thus, each era chooses its own scope of freedom that defines its capacity to engage with knowledge, shaping the historical being (Dasein).

The chapter concludes by asserting that Heidegger's philosophy is not aimed at offering immediate practical applications, but rather at opening up spaces for reflecting on the degree and kind of freedom a culture affords itself and its commitment to questioning.

10).

Chapter Ten addresses the contemplative nature of questioning and the need for careful consideration, articulating that decisions concerning knowledge are not arrived at passively but require active, detailed, and prolonged inquiry. The historical and transformative approaches to questioning are pivotal themes of the chapter.

Key concepts and insights from Chapter Ten:

    Importance of Questioning: Heidegger stresses the indispensability of questioning and its significance, depth, and certainty, as only through questioning can one truly grasp and master the self-evident truths that race beyond our understanding.

    Historical Consciousness: The chapter emphasizes the necessity for historical consciousness, quoting Nietzsche on immense self-reflection necessary to understand mankind and its accumulated knowledge and experiences.

    Historical Nature of Questions: The chapter reveals that questions like "What is a thing?" possess a historical character, and thus, the common answers to this question come from a particular past. It entails that understanding the history behind our perceptions is crucial to genuinely grasping any subject matter.

    Historical Investigation: Heidegger’s approach suggests that historical investigation is not merely a static reporting of the past but a means to understand what is still unfolding and its implications for contemporary thought.

    Historical Origin of Definitions: The chapter discusses how the definitions of a thing, proposition, and truth evolved historically, starting from the Greeks—particularly from Plato and Aristotle—and changing over time through different philosophical movements.

    Correlation of Thing, Proposition, and Truth: Heidegger connects the essence of the thing with the essence of the proposition and truth, raising the question whether these essences arose coincidentally or are intrinsically linked. He also explores whether things are adapted to our concepts and propositions or vice versa.

    Human Perspective and Measure: The chapter references Protagoras' proposition that "Man is the measure of all things," indicating that historical understanding of concepts such as 'proposition' and 'thing' might reflect the human-centric perspective of their time.

In Chapter Ten, Heidegger demonstrates that understanding the essence of things is not just a theoretical endeavor but also a reflective journey through the accumulated wisdom and changes within historical contexts. He invites the reader to think historically, not only to grasp what has passed but also to engage with the ongoing development within philosophical thought.

11).

Chapter Eleven continues to unravel the historical essence of questioning and decision-making in philosophy, emphasizing how such inquiries always carry with them the weight of histories and previous understandings.

Key concepts and insights from Chapter Eleven:

    Historical Substance of Questions: Heidegger illustrates that the essence of any question, including "What is a thing?", is historically determined. It's not merely a matter of idle curiosity but a deliberate decision to engage with the legacy of those who have pondered before us.

    Persistent Presence of the Past: The historical understanding of things as bearers of qualities and propositions as bearers of truth is not something relegated to the distant past but, according to Heidegger, a dynamic and persisting foundation of present and future thought.

    Revisiting the Grounds of Philosophy: Heidegger calls upon us to return to the fundamental philosophical inquiries initiated by the Greeks — particularly Plato and Aristotle — not to dwell on them but to discern their contemporary significance and endurance.

    Transformation of Basic Positions: Responses to philosophical questions are not merely definitions but transformative basic positions. The inquiry aims not just to answer what a thing is but to change the whole position towards things and questionings, leading to an elevated understanding.

    Entanglement of Thought and Being: Delving into past philosophical ideas is not about agreeing or disagreeing with them but rather about understanding our entanglement with these ideas and how they continue to shape our approach to knowledge.

    Holistic Consideration of Greek Existence: To truly grasp the depth of Greek thought on the nature of things, one must consider the entirety of Greek existence, including their concept of deity, politics, art, and knowledge.

    The Task of Decisions: The chapter posits that philosophical thought is marked by decisions and actions, and these decisions are always historical. It is not enough to extract a definition of a 'thing' from the past; our engagement with this definition in the present involves an act of decision-making that has transformative power.

Chapter Eleven, therefore, poses a reflective challenge to the audience: to reinterpret historical philosophical thought not as static knowledge to be reported but as active, formative engagements that shape our current intellectual landscape.


12). 

Chapter Twelve draws together the theme of history's relationship with the question of "What is a thing?" Heidegger does this by emphasizing the significance of the orientation towards nature in our conception of things. He also describes modern natural science as a way of thinking shaped by history that holds us captive and may limit our freedom in determining and understanding things.

Key concepts and insights from Chapter Twelve:

    Historical Basis of Our Understanding: Heidegger insists that our idea of a thing—now thought to be primarily material, based on mass, and quantifiable in spatial-temporal terms—is not inherent but historically predominant due to modern science’s influence.

    Material Thing as the Ground: There is a deep analysis of the contemporary idea of the material thing (Stoffding) being considered the basis of all things. This view stretches beyond the physical realm into the "spiritual" or conceptual realms, such as our understanding of language, history, and art.

    Influence on Education and Culture: Heidegger reflects on the effect of viewing poems as things and how this mindset might lead to an uninspired approach to teaching and interpreting poetry in education, demonstrating how the materialistic conception of a thing permeates diverse areas of knowledge and experience.

    Call for Historical Consciousness: Heidegger continues to encourage a historical consciousness that would facilitate grasping the implications of our own preoccupation with science and the modern conception of things.

    The Question as a Historical Decision: The chapter portrays the question "What is a thing?" not merely as a query but as a historical decision that needs to be addressed actively, suggesting that significant change in understanding takes not just a lecture or a discussion but possibly a century.

    Philosophical Inquiry as an Open Question: Heidegger concludes the discussion with the idea that the question of "What is a thing?" should remain an open one, which requires ongoing attention instead of a definitive answer, and the true disaster lies not in failing to reach an answer but in failing to acknowledge the seriousness of the question itself.

Thus, Chapter Twelve wraps up the discourse with a powerful reminder of the historical weight behind our conceptual orientations and the importance of being attentive to the depths of such foundational questions.
